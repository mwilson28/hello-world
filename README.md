I'm learning how to code
I've avoided this for most of my life. Yet I do think that one day maybe thsi is useful.
As you can tell I'm not great at spelling which is why I have silently feared coding for the first 22.5 years of my young life.
But here I am tackling my fears. 
That's all for now folks.
